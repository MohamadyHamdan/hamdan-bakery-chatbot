Tagline: Warm bread, honest ingredients.

hamdan_bakery is a neighborhood bakery focused on slow-fermented breads, classic viennoiserie,
heritage-inspired pastries, and custom celebration cakes. We use stone‑milled flours,
real butter, seasonal produce, and avoid artificial additives. Our menu highlights
signature sourdough loaves, baguettes, multigrain breads, croissants, chocolate
hazelnut croissants, za’atar and cheese bakes, cookies, and weekly limited editions.
